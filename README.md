# xG Data Analysis

The goal of this project is to perform a short statistical analysis based on the xgoals (xG) statistic of three football clubs that compete in the Premier League (Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool) for the season 21/22. In a nutshell, the xG correspond to the number of goals that are expected to be scored by a team based on the field position and shot technique. Therefore, using this metric, a qualitative understanding of the performance of each team throughout the season is derived.

The data for the three teams were obtained from [understat.com](https://understat.com/) and are analysed using Python, Excel and Mathematica.
