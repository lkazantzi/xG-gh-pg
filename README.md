# xG Data Analysis
The goal of this project is to perform a short statistical analysis based on the xgoals (xG) of three football clubs that compete in the Premier League (Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool) for the 22/23 season to have a qualitative understanding of the season of each team.

## Description
In a nutshell the xG correspond to the number of goals that can be expected to be scored based on where and how a shot was taken. Therefore, using this metric a qualitative understanding of each match is achieved and utilizing the data from each matchweek the form of each team is derived. The results are analysed using Python, Excel as well as Mathematica.

## Versions
* Version 2.0: Major updates
    * Data updated including now the 2022-2023 data for the three teams.
    * Python code reconstructed using Object Oriented Programming techniques. In order to find the excel file Data.xlsx, that includes the data, a new folder should be created entitled `2022_2023_Data`. In the case that the Python code is running on macos, then probably the optional dependency `openpyxl` should be installed first before running the code. In order to correctly implement this dependency, the laptop should be restarted after the installation of the package.
    * The .txt files are used only to load the data in the Mathematica (.nb) file
       
## Data Availability 
The data for the three teams were obtained from [understat.com](https://understat.com/).
